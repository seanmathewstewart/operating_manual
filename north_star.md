# North Star Metric SFD Logic

## Introduction
Every company needs a **North Star metric** — a long‑term leading indicator of success that everyone can understand and remember. At its best, it drives decision‑making, creates clarity, and aligns our success with our customers’ success. 

At Sana, our North Star metric is:

> **Customer Value** — the annual, measurable economic impact Sana delivers to its customers, expressed in euros and driven by *revenue growth* and *cost reduction*.

Our ambition: **€1B+ in annual customer value by 2028**.

This document outlines a recommended method for calculating Customer Value.

## Risk and Objective
When calculating customer value, the customer must **recognize and trust the number**. If they don’t, the metric is useless — or damaging.

Example: 6sense repeatedly presented value reports that were incorrect or misleading (e.g., using Total Contract Value instead of Monthly, taking credit for all touched revenue). This destroyed credibility.

**Objective:**  
Calculate customer value in a simple, understandable, verifiable way that reflects Sana‑generated value and is trusted by the customer.

---

## How Do We Do This?
Sana creates value in many ways, but for the first version, focus on just two simple, customer‑verifiable components:

1. **Incremental Revenue Change**  
2. **Cost Reduction via Online Orders**

---

# Incremental Revenue Change

### Definition
Incremental Revenue =  
**Revenue This Period – Revenue Last Period**

It represents revenue that **would not have occurred without Sana**, measured at the *customer’s customer* level.

### Required Metrics (per end‑customer)
- Revenue This Period  
- Revenue Last Period  
- Incremental Revenue  
- Online Revenue This Period  
- Online Revenue Last Period  
- Incremental Online Revenue

Period = 6 or 12 months (aligned to Sana license start).

### What We Want to Capture
- Incremental Revenue Change per customer  
- Incremental Online Revenue Change per customer  
- The difference between them (to isolate Sana’s impact)

## Four Scenarios
Using example customer "Gatto BV":

### **1. No Incremental Revenue**
Incremental Revenue ≤ 0 → Sana adds **no incremental revenue**, although customer value may still exist via automation.

### **2. Incremental Revenue > 0, but Online Incremental = 0**
Incremental revenue not driven by online → **Sana adds no incremental revenue**.

### **3. Both Incremental Revenue and Incremental Online Revenue > 0**
Sana contributed to incremental revenue. Determine how much:

- If *Incremental Revenue < Incremental Online Revenue* → take **Incremental Revenue**  
- If *Incremental Revenue > Incremental Online Revenue* → take **Incremental Online Revenue**

This avoids overstating transitions from offline to online.

### **4. New Customer (Last Period = 0)**
Same calculation as scenario 3 — simply no baseline period.

---

### Potential Challenges
- Do we have historic online/offline revenue?  
- Revenue ≠ profit; customer profitability might still decline.  
- Depends on customer maintaining a clean customer list (e.g., mergers create data confusion).

---

# Cost Reductions via Online Ordering
Regardless of revenue changes, **every online order delivers cost savings**.

### Two Ways to Determine Cost per Order

#### 1. **Market Research Approach**
Based on region, industry, wage levels, order volume. Good for benchmarks but too generic for customer‑specific value.

#### 2. **Customer‑Specific Cost‑Per‑Order Calculator**
Captures inputs such as:  
- FTEs involved in order processing  
- Error rates  
- Average order size  
- Order volume  
- Cost of legacy order software

This builds trust and provides a credible basis for cost savings.

> Recommended:  
> 1. Use a **default CPO** based on market research.  
> 2. Enhance with **a customer‑specific calculator** when possible.

---

### Potential Challenges
- Most customers **don’t know their true cost per order** → we should help them calculate it.
- A calculator helps build the business case and trust.

# Closing
Aligning everyone to a **North Star Metric** is essential. The calculation must both represent the value Sana creates *and* be recognizable and trusted by customers. Start simple, only add complexity when necessary.

---

# FAQ
### **Can Sana provide negative Customer Value?**
No. Every order through Sana produces value — but value ≠ ROI.

### **What about catalogue‑only customers?**
This is a bad use case; they should either churn or adopt full web‑shop functionality.

### **What about the next‑best alternative?**
Some alternatives may generate equal or more value at lower cost. No simple answer yet.

### **Who should own Customer Value calculation?**
**Product** — Ops defines inputs, Product owns implementation and feasibility.
